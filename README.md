# GRIP_TASK3_EDA_SUPERSTORE
I've made this project as a part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation under Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) . My task was to Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ and  to ﬁnd out the weak areas where one can work to make more proﬁt.It can be opened on jupyter notebook as well as google collab. I've worked with google colab, so a different library is used to upload the csv file. if you are using jupyter notebook, give the path of the file then use read_csv(path) as usual.
